# Project Portfolio – Yamuna Elangovan  

## 📌 About Me  

My name is Yamuna Elangovan. I completed my MSc in Information Technology from Alagappa University, Devakottai. I have one year of real-time experience as a Software Developer at IndiaFilings Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, from September 2024 to November 2025.

My work mainly focused on backend development and automation. I built automated workflows using Selenium for government portals such as FSSAI registration, eMudhra, and Care4Sign. These involved end-to-end form submission, OTP handling, CAPTCHA solving, and extracting application IDs. I also developed APIs using Flask, integrated GET/POST workflows, handled JSON data, and tested APIs using Postman. I have hands-on experience with SQL for storing and managing structured data.

I am currently looking for a Software Developer or QA Automation role where I can apply my backend, automation, and problem-solving skills while continuing to grow into a stronger developer.

# Experience 
# Software Developer 
    I built an automation system for government registrations like FSSAI and DSC using Flask and Selenium. The client sends user data and documents in JSON, and my Flask API starts a Selenium thread that automatically fills government forms, solves CAPTCHA, uploads decoded base64 documents, handles OTP verification, and extracts the final application numbers. I also implemented session management, OTP polling, OCR-based CAPTCHA solving, and temporary file handling. This system reduced manual work, minimized errors, and improved speed.
    
# Responsibilities

Developed and maintained Python-based automation scripts using Selenium to streamline data entry, form submission, and verification workflows.

Built Flask APIs for handling automation triggers, CAPTCHA solving, and integration with internal tools.

Implemented web scraping solutions using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract, clean, and structure data from government and third-party portals.

Designed dynamic form-handling logic to manage conditional dropdowns, category mappings, and multi-step application flows.

Created CAPTCHA automation pipelines, including model-based predictions, API-based solvers, and retry logic for incorrect validation.

Performed API integration and testing using Python, Flask, requests, and Postman.

Monitored automation runs, logged failures, and performed quick fixes to ensure smooth execution and data accuracy.

Improved application reliability by implementing error handling, retry mechanisms, timeouts, and exception logging.

Optimized Python modules, reusable components, and helper functions to reduce code duplication and increase maintainability.

Coordinated with senior developers and ops teams to deploy automation scripts, update configurations, and handle real-time issues.
